# GameJam

A little platformer made with GODOT Game Engine that we made as a gift to a friend in only 2 nights of work. While its code is rough and has room for lots of improvements it was nice to see most contributors apply agile methodologies since it was their first time.

It's still in my TODO list to improve most of the gameplay and textures.
