# GameJam

A little platformer made with GODOT Game Engine that we made as a gift to a friend in only 2 nights of work. While its code is rough and has room for lots of improvements it was nice to see most contributors apply agile methodologies since it was their first time.
Just a bit of an experiment done in around 24hs by an unexperienced team
